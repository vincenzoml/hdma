In this section we show that our automata can be used to model interesting properties of real-life distributed systems. Consider a peer to peer system where each peer receives queries from other peers and buffers them. Then one query is selected, among the buffered ones, and is served by establishing a temporary connection with the target peer. This is what happens e.g.\ in Gnutella\todo{piÃ¹ o meno}.
% and serves them in a first-come-first-served order. The number of unserved queries at each time is bounded, say at most $n$. When a query is selected to be served, the peer established a temporary connection with the target peer. We assume that peers have a fair behavior, i.e.\ they do not accept other queries from peers that have already sent one, if this has yet to be served.

%We want to model such a peer as an automaton, as succinct as possible, i.e.\ with a small number of states and transitions. 
These systems typically run forever, so it is reasonable to capture their behavior as an infinite sequence of actions. We assume peers have four kinds of observable actions: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item arrival of a new query from $p$, denoted $q(p)$; 
	\item selection of a query to serve, denoted $s(p)$; 
	\item connection to $p$ to serve its request, denoted $c(p)$; 
	\item disconnection from $p$, denoted $d(p)$.
\end{itemize}
%
Notice, however, that the number of possible peer identifiers $p$ can be huge. This means that an ordinary automaton modeling a peer may have a very large number of states and transitions. However, using our notion of automaton, where actions are ``symbolic'', we can obtain very compact models.

We will give automata for two query selection policies: \emph{FCFS fair policy} and \emph{friend policy}. Then, using results from \autoref{sec:boolean-operations-decidability}, the negation of these automata can be intersected with a user-defined peer model: if the resulting automaton has empty language, which is a decidable property, then the peer complies with those policies.
%one can give an automaton representing a peer and check that the intersection of 


%The crucial idea is using symbolic actions:

\paragraph{FCFS fair policy.}
We want to model query selection in a FCFS style. Moreover, we want to capture fairness: queries from already buffered peers are discarded. We assume that the buffer has size $n$.

%
The automaton is shown in \autoref{fig:fcfs}. Each state $q_i,s_i,c_i$ is equipped with $i$ registers, for $i=i,\dots,n$, and $q_0$ has no registers. Each transition has a function saying how registers in the target state take values from those of the source state.
\[
	enq_i(x) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\star & x = i \\
		x & x < i
	\end{cases}
	\qquad
%	shift(x) =
%x	\begin{cases}
%		\star & x = n \\
%		x+1 & x< n
%	\end{cases}
	\qquad
	deq_i(x) = x + 1
\]
%
The intuition is that transitions from $q_i$ to $q_{i+1}$ correspond to buffering a ``fresh'' query, that is one whose sender is not already buffered, in register $i+1$. The loop on $q_n$ discards new peers when the buffer is full. A transition from $q_i$ to $s_i$ picks the query $p$ in register $1$, that is always the oldest one; transition $s_i$ to $c_i$ establishes a connection to $p$; transition $c_i$ to $q_{i-1}$ removes $p$ from the buffer, and shifts the registers' content so that now register $1$ contains the query that arrived right after the one of $p$. In order to have a deterministic automaton, we assume each state has all possible outgoing transitions: those not shown in\autoref{fig:fcfs} are assumed to go to a sink state. The acceptance conditions contains all subsets of the states of this automaton, excluding the sink one.

\paragraph{Friend queries.} We introduce the concept of \emph{friend query}. This a query coming from a ``friend'' peer, which should be served as soon as possible, that is: after the current query has been served.
